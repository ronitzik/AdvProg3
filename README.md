## Background
In recent years, many people choose to do their shopping online. Seeing this great business opportunity, you decide to open up your own online store for the masses. In this store youâ€™ll be able to offer all sorts of items, give out special deals to your customers and most importantly, charge for the products you sell.

Being a gifted Python programmer you decide to write the main logic of the online store in Python. You will write an API for the front end to use when it is eventually implemented.



## Design
After an extensive brainstorming session you have reached the following design:

Each item in your store will be an instance of the class Item (this class is further described below).

When first initailizing the store, it would load a file with all the available items.

Customers will be able to do the following:

Search for items
Add items to their shopping cart
Remove items from their shopping cart
Purchase the items in their shopping cart
For extra profit, similar items to the ones the customer purchased will be highlighted.
